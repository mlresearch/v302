title: Benchmarking Automatic Speech Recognition Models for African Languages
abstract: 'Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages remains constrained
  by limited labeled data and the lack of systematic guidance on model selection,
  data scaling, and decoding strategies. Large pre-trained systems such as Whisper,
  XLS-R, MMS, and W2v-BERT have expanded access to ASR technology, but their comparative
  behavior in African low-resource contexts has not been studied in a unified and
  systematic way. In this work, we benchmark four state-of-the-art ASR models across
  13 African languages, fine-tuning them on progressively larger subsets of transcribed
  data ranging from 1 to 400 hours. Beyond reporting error rates, we provide new insights
  into why models behave differently under varying conditions. We show that MMS and
  W2v-BERT are more data efficient in very low-resource regimes, XLS-R scales more
  effectively as additional data becomes available, and Whisper demonstrates advantages
  in mid-resource conditions. We also analyze where external language model decoding
  yields improvements and identify cases where it plateaus or introduces additional
  errors, depending on the alignment between acoustic and text resources. By highlighting
  the interaction between pre-training coverage, model architecture, dataset domain,
  and resource availability, this study offers practical and insights into the design
  of ASR systems for underrepresented languages. <b>Keywords</b>: Automatic Speech
  Recognition, African Languages, Low-Resource ASR, Pre-trained Models, Language Modeling.'
