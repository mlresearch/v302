title: Sentiment Polarity Analysis of Amharic Climate Change Discourse Using Large
  Language Models
abstract: 'Climate change refers to variations in temperature and weather conditions
  due to various climate-related factors on earth. These factors vary across regions,
  and people’s perceptions of climate change. Analyzing public opinion on climate
  change at a regional level is crucial for developing targeted solutions. However,
  manually analyzing large volumes of data is challenging for informed dissension.
  Applying emerging pre-trained Large Language Models offers a promising solution
  for efficiently analyzing large datasets and understanding public perspectives on
  climate change. Amharic is one of the widely spoken African languages. Many speakers
  of the language are actively discussing and expressing their opinions on various
  topics, including climate change, on social media. Given the increasing discussions
  about climate change, this study focuses on the sentiment analysis of Amharic climate
  texts. We collected 6013 sentences from social media and news sources. The data
  is annotated manually by native speakers to its target polarity. We conducted experiments
  using the LLM that supports African languages during pre-training. In this study,
  MultilingualBert and AfriBERTa models were employed with hyperparameter tuning to
  perform sentiment polarity analysis on Amharic climate text. The experimental results
  shows that MultilingualBert outperforms AfriBERTa, achieving an accuracy of 69%.
  This performance is attributed to MultilingualBert’s enhanced capability to capture
  token-level semantics by giving a variety of attention across tokens, thereby improving
  its contextual understanding in downstream sentiment classification tasks. <b>Keywords</b>:
  Climate NLP, Sentiment, LLM, mBERT, AfriBERTa, Climate Sentiment.'
