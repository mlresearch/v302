title: A Fully Neural Tunisian Arabic TTS System
abstract: 'The discipline of Text-To-Speech (TTS) focuses on the artificial generation
  of spoken language from text, a technology increasingly vital for voice-based applications.
  Recognizing the rising demand for realistic computer-generated speech, especially
  for under-represented accents and dialects, this research is driven by the goal
  of constructing a high-quality Tunisian Arabic TTS system. Highlighting the underdeveloped
  state of advanced natural language processing technologies like TTS in Tunisia,
  this paper introduces our work on recording a dedicated Tunisian female Arabic speech
  dataset. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end deep learning TTS system built upon
  a deep neural network architecture. A subjective evaluation using Mean Opinion Score
  (MOS) was conducted, comparing our approach to end-to-end generative and concatenative
  models. The results of this evaluation indicate that our proposed system outperforms
  both baselines in terms of both naturalness and intelligibility. <b>Keywords</b>:
