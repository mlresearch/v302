title: Fairness-Aware Machine Learning for Social Bias Detection in Healthcare Research
  Datasets
abstract: 'This work presents an automated tool for detecting and measuring bias in
  healthcare datasets and predictive models. We evaluated fairness at both the data
  and algorithmic levels using metrics including Statistical Parity Difference (SPD),
  Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD), and Demographic Disparity. Using the SyntheticMass
  (healthcare expenses) and Brain Stroke healthcare datasets, we found that SyntheticMass
  showed substantial demographic imbalance (83.6% White patients) and age-based disparities
  (SPD: 0.82 for younger vs. elderly patients). While the Brain Stroke dataset exhibited
  more balanced demographics, we identified substantial disparities in stroke outcomes
  between age groups. Across both datasets, neural networks consistently outperformed
  traditional machine learning models on fairness metrics. In the Brain Stroke dataset,
  neural networks achieved both higher accuracy (94.8% vs. 91.8% for the best traditional
  model) and nearly perfect fairness scores (SPD: 0.000–0.0007; EOD: 0.000–0.0128).
  Additionally, we introduced a combined scoring metric that equally weights accuracy
  and fairness, providing researchers with a practical framework for model selection
  that prioritizes both dimensions. The interactive visualization dashboard makes
  fairness analysis accessible to medical researchers without specialized knowledge
  of fairness-aware machine learning.  <b>Keywords</b>: healthcare bias, fairness
  evaluation, machine learning, neural networks, statistical parity, equal opportunity,
  demographic disparity.'
