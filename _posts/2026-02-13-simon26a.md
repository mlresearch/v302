title: 'Large Vocabulary Read-Mode Speech Corpora for Low-Resourced Ometo Languages:
  Gamo, Gofa, Dawuro and Wolaita'
abstract: 'Speech is a fundamental mode of human communication and has also become
  a popular way for people to interact with machines through the use of speech technology.
  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is one of speech technologies which transcribes
  speech to its corresponding text using numerous techniques and facilitates communication
  between human and electronic devices. To make it a real large amount of speech dataset
  parallel with its transcription is necessary. However, developing a large amount
  of corpora through collection and pre-processing is very expensive for many languages,
  including Ometo languages. This is mainly because they are classified as low-resource
  languages, lacking sufficient linguistic data and technological resources. In order
  to solve the problem of data scarcity for Ometo languages: Gamo, Gofa, Dawuro, and
  Wolaita, we have developed large speech corpora of 24.3511 hr with its corresponding
  transcription for four Ometo languages. Then, we have developed ASR systems for
  each language to verify the usability of the corpora using a deep learning technique.
  We have achieved WER of 72.00%, 57.94%, 62.22%, 64.71% for Gamo, Gofa, Dawuro and
  Wolaita languages, respectively. In order to demonstrate that the corpora are appropriate
  for additional research toward the creation of ASR systems, we present the corpora
  and the baseline ASR systems we have constructed in this study. The corpora can
  therefore be used by researchers to improve speech processing systems.  <b>Keywords</b>:
