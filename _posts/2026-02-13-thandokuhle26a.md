title: 'Towards Language Representation for SiSwati: A Comparative Analysis of Sub-word
  Tokenization Algorithms'
abstract: 'Many African languages, including SiSwati, are underrepresented in current
  AI interactions due to challenges such as imprecise language representation. This
  study investigates various sub-word tokenization algorithms for building monolingual
  SiSwati tokenizers, a critical step towards enhancing its linguistic representation.
  We implement and compare Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), Unigram Language Model (ULM),
  and WordPiece algorithms, evaluating their performance with three distinct vocabulary
  sizes: 32K, 50K, and 70K. The tokenizers’ outputs were assessed on a downstream
  sentiment analysis task using multiple classifiers. The results demonstrate that
  sub-word representation is effective for SiSwati and that monolingual tokenizers
  can achieve morphologically-aware sub-word segmentation. Notably, Unigram with a
  32K vocabulary paired with an XGBoost classifier yielded the highest peak F1-score,
  though BPE and WordPiece also offered more stable performance across different vocabulary
  capacities, with 32K vocabularies often proving sufficient for these two. These
  findings highlight the significant interplay between tokenizer algorithm type, vocabulary
  size, and classifier choice in developing tools for low-resource, morphologically
  rich languages. <b>Keywords</b>: Tokenization, low-resource, vocabulary size, morphologically-rich
  language.'
