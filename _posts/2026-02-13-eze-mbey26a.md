title: Ẹhugbo Ka! Advancing Machine Translation for the Low-Resource Ẹhugbo Language
  through Parallel Corpus Development
abstract: 'Despite advancements in language technologies, there consistently seems
  to be an exclusion of low-resource African languages and their dialects like Ẹhugbo,
  a critically endangered variant of Igbo spoken by fewer than 150,000 people in Afikpo,
  Nigeria. This exclusion perpetuates social and linguistic inequities, leaving speakers
  of such dialects without access to digital tools that could preserve their language
  and culture. This paper presents Ẹhugbo Ka! (”Greetings Ẹhugbo!”) addresses this
  gap. We gathered and built the only publicly available parallel corpus, 1,021 Ẹhugbo-English
  sentences from the New Testament of the Bible, we evaluated and fine-tuned two state-of-the-art
  models, M2M100 (facebook/m2m100 418M) and NLLB (facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M).
  Initial results were stark: M2M100 achieved a BLEU score of 1.2188, while NLLB scored
  only 0.0262. After fine-tuning, M2M100 improved to 16.1719, and NLLB achieved 20.4016,
  demonstrating the potential of adapting LLMs for low-resource languages. Our findings
  reveal both promise and challenges. While fine-tuning significantly improves performance,
  the lack of diverse datasets limits translation quality and reinforces the need
  for inclusive data collection practices. This work highlights the importance of
  community-driven approaches, as linguistic preservation cannot be achieved without
  the active involvement of native speakers.This project not only advances the field
  of low resource MT but also serves as a call to action for researchers and developers
  to prioritize linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind in
  the digital age. <b>Keywords:</b> multilingual low resource, resources for less-resourced
  languages, minoritized languages, less resourced languages, endangered languages,
  indigenous languages, corpus creation, multilingual corpora, evaluation, datasets
  for low resource languages, Igbo, Igbo language.'
