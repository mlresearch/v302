title: 'The State of Large Language Models for African Languages: Progress and Challenges'
abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Natural Language Processing
  (NLP), but their benefits are largely absent for Africa’s 2,000 low-resource languages.
  This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across six LLMs, eight
  Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs). The evaluation covers
  language coverage, training sets, technical limitations, script problems, and language
  modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 41 supported African languages and 23 available
  public data sets, and it shows a big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili,
  Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are always treated while there is over 98% of unsupported
  African languages. Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge’ez
  scripts are identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary
  challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, very high computational costs,
  and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization, corpus development
  by the community, and effective adaptation methods for African languages. <b>Keywords</b>:
  Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), Low resource languages,
  Specialized SLMs (SSLMs)'
