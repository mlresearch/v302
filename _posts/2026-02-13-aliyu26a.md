title: 'Evaluating Deep Learning Models for African Wildlife Image Classification:
  From DenseNet to Vision Transformers'
abstract: 'Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
  declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image classification
  using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for biodiversity monitoring
  and conservation. This paper presents a comparative study of deep learning models
  for automatically classifying African wildlife images, focusing on transfer learning
  with frozen feature extractors. Using a public dataset of four species: buffalo,
  elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152,
  EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best
  performance among convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved
  the highest overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational
  cost, raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
  accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN (DenseNet-201)
  was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time field use, demonstrating
  the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in conservation settings. This work
  contributes to African-grounded AI research by offering practical insights into
  model selection, dataset preparation, and responsible deployment of deep learning
  tools for wildlife conservation. <b>Keywords</b>:Image Classification, DenseNet,
  African wildlife, Computer Vision, Deep learning.'
