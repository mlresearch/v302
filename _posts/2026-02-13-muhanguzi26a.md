title: Optimisation of a Raspberry Pi-based Bioacoustic Sensor for Data Collection
abstract: 'This paper details the optimisation of a Raspberry Pi-based bioacoustic
  sensing system designed for data collection for acoustic classification of birds.
  Optimised sensors are desirable when collecting data off-the-grid. The acoustic
  sensor’s power consumption was studied under various conditions, such as using a
  full and Lite Raspberry Pi OS to guide the sensor’s optimisation. The power management
  board used to power the sensor was also redesigned to improve efficiency. A machine
  learning model to classify 3 bird species and other sounds with an accuracy of 93%
  and loss of 30% on the test set was developed. An 80%-10%-10% train, test and validation
  split ratio was used to train and evaluate the model which was then quantized to
  tensorflowlite to run directly on the raspberry pi hardware in a miniaturized format.
  The optimised sensor was then deployed at a Wildlife Conservancy in Africa, Kenya
  to continously collect data and perform inference at the edge. <b>Keywords</b>:
  Bioacoustics, Raspberry Pi, Sensor Optimisation, Off-grid Data Collection, Power
  Management, machine learning, quantization, miniaturized.'
