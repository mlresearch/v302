title: 'Culturally Attuned and Resource-Aware Foundation Models for East African Agriculture:
  A Theoretical Framework and Research Agenda'
abstract: 'East African agriculture supports more than 175 million people but faces
  mounting challenges from climate change, resource constraints, and information access
  barriers. Current foundation models fail to address the region’s computational limitations
  (devices with 1-4GB RAM), linguistic diversity (200+ languages), and knowledge system
  differences. This paper presents CARA-FM (Culturally Attuned and Resource-Aware
  Foundation Models), a theoretical framework comprising four pillars: Community-Driven
  Data Architecture, Indigenous Knowledge Systems, Edge-First Model Design, and Participatory
  Governance. We propose evaluation metrics that span the technical (computational
  efficiency), agricultural (yield improvement), and cultural (community acceptance)
  dimensions. Although empirically unvalidated, this framework provides a research
  agenda for developing agricultural AI systems that operate within severe resource
  constraints and respect local contexts. Our contribution is theoretical and offers
  a blueprint for future empirical work rather than implemented solutions. <b>Keywords</b>:
  Foundation Models, Agricultural AI, Theoretical Framework, East Africa, Resource-Constrained
  Computing, Indigenous Knowledge.'
