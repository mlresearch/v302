title: 'An AI Tomato Leaf Doctor Using MobileNetV2 and Streamlit: A Lightweight Deep
  Learning Tool for Farmers'
abstract: 'Tomato farming in Eswatini faces severe yield losses (up to 70 percent)
  due to diseases such as late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and bacterial leaf
  spot (Xanthomonas spp.), caused by climate variability and limited access to localized
  diagnostic tools. Existing AI solutions, such as Plantix, lack region-specific treatment
  advice, excluding farmers in low bandwidth areas. This study introduces AI Tomato
  Leaf Doctor, a Streamlit deployed, two stage MobileNetV2 system pretrained on ImageNet
  and fine-tuned. From experimental analysis, it is seen that plant leaf disease detection
  using MobileNetV2 outperforms existing approach in terms of accuracy as well as
  training time. The first model filters non tomato inputs, other plants or objects,
  while the second classifies ten tomato conditions (nine diseases and one healthy)
  using a PlantVillage dataset of 20,000 images (2000 per class). The model achieved
  97 percent accuracy. The app provides chemical dosages for locally available fungicides
  and their market prices in Eswatini Lilangeni (SZL), delivered via a farmer friendly
  interface. By leveraging MobileNetV2’s lightweight design and Streamlit’s cloud
  compatibility, this work bridges the gap between AI innovation and the practical
  needs of Eswatini’s tomato-dependent households. <b>Keywords</b>: Tomato Disease
  Detection, MobileNetV2, Streamlit, PlantVillage Dataset, Eswatini Agriculture, Lightweight
