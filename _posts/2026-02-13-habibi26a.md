title: Adaptive UAV Inspection of PV Panels Using Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning
  and Zigzag Coverage Planning
abstract: Accurate and efficient inspection of photovoltaic (PV) panels is critical
  for early anomaly detection and energy yield optimization. This study presents an
  autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV-based inspection framework that leverages
  Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) for adaptive path tracking. The UAV
  follows a mathematically defined zigzag trajectory while dynamically responding
  to disturbances such as wind drift. Instead of rigid waypoint following, the agent
  is conditioned on successive inspection goals and learns optimal movement strategies
  using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The environment incorporates realistic
  wind noise and UAV momentum, requiring the policy to learn corrective behaviors
  under uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate the agent’s ability to achieve
  robust full-surface coverage, minimize overlap, and maintain trajectory alignment,
  highlighting the effectiveness of this learning-based inspection strategy. <b>Keywords:</b>
  PV inspection, UAV path tracking, Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning, PPO,
  Zigzag trajectory, Wind robustness, Autonomous drone coverage.
