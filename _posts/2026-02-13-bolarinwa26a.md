title: 'Closing the Gap in Low-Resource ASR: Leveraging Multilingual Models for Code-Switched
  Yoruba-English Speech'
abstract: 'Recent advancements in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have revolutionized
  voice-based technologies, yet challenges persist in achieving accurate recognition
  for multilingual and low-resource languages. This research explores the performance
  of state-of-the-art multilingual ASR models (Whisper Large v3 and MMS-1B-All) on
  Yoruba-English code-switched (CS) speech. Despite notable progress in multilingual
  ASR, code-switching remains a complex challenge due to the linguistic intricacies
  introduced by phonetic, syntactic, and lexical shifts within single utterances.
  This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by evaluating these models
  on a 21-hour Yoruba-English dataset and finetuned for domain-specific performance.
  Results show that fine-tuning led to substantial improvements in Word Error Rate
  (WER), with MMS-1B-All achieving a 55.8% reduction and Whisper Large v3 showing
  a 50.1% reduction. Although MMS-1B-All outperformed Whisper Large v3 slightly, both
  models demonstrated strong potential for ASR in Yoruba-English CS speech recognition.
  This study highlights the feasibility of fine-tuning multilingual ASR models for
  low-resource code-switched scenarios and suggests directions for future research,
  including dataset expansion, alternative fine-tuning strategies, and real-time performance
  evaluation. <b>Keywords</b>: automatic speech recognition, code-switching, multilingual
  ASR, low-resource languages'
